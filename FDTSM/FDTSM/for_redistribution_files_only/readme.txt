Verify the MATLAB Runtime is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 9.0.1 (R2016a).   

Once the MATLAB runtime is installed, double clock FDTSM.exe.

Use the Open File to load a file.
The sliders allow for speed adjustment from 50% to 200% with each slider modifying approximately an octave.

This is alpha software, so there are still a number of graphical glitches that need to be 
squashed in the Windows version. If you have ideas of ways the user interface could be improved, please send me an email at timothy.roberts(at)griffithuni.edu.au

It is possible with the algorithm implemented to have up to 1024 frequency ranges, I just haven't implemented a GUI for that yet.  If you are interested in further testing, please also email me, or check out the source code at www.github.com/zygurt/TSM/FDTSM
